            YES. If you wish to edit your choices after locking but before the
            choice filing deadline, you can do so by first submitting a request
            to unlock in the online JoSAA portal.

          In the event that I forget to lock my choices on the JOSAA portal,
          will I still be eligible for the allotment process?

        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            There's no need to worry about forgetting to lock your choices on
            the JOSAA portal because they will be automatically locked once the
            choice filing deadline has passed.

          What are the steps to be followed after being allotted a seat through
          the JOSAA portal?
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            If you are allocated a seat in a certain round of JoSAA, you need to
            follow steps for online reporting that include (i) acceptance of the
            seat, (ii) uploading of documents and (iii) payment of seat
            acceptance fee.If you fail to follow any of the steps you cannot go
            for further rounds of allotment.

        <button class="accordion">
          What are FLOAT, SLIDE , FREEZE options in the allotment process ?
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            These options appear after you got allotted in any of the rounds
            rather than last round i.e. Round 6 <br />
            <b>FLOAT </b>: This option helps you to participate in further
            rounds of allotment and will consider all the upper options and the
            options(choices) below the allotted choice will be deleted
            automatically. <br />
            <b>SLIDE </b>– When a candidate chooses the 'Slide' option, it means
            that they have accepted the offered seat but if an admission is
            offered to an academic program of higher preference in the 'same
            institute,' they will accept it in subsequent rounds of JoSAA
            Counseling. <br />
            <b>FREEZE :</b> Candidate choosing Freeze agrees and accepts the
            offered seat and also agrees that he/she would not participate in
            the counseling anymore. It is a final 'lock' on the seat offered and
            once freeze is accepted, the seat is provisionally allotted to the
            candidate
          </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">
          Is it possible to switch from the "freeze" option to the "slide/float"
          option after making a selection?
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            You MUST pay the seat acceptance fee and complete all the steps of
            the online reporting process in the same round of seat allocation
            for continuing with the JoSAAprocess to avail the seat in IITs or
            NITs system. Your allocated seat will be CANCELED and you will no
            longer be able to participate in the subsequent rounds of seat
            allocation process (if any) if you do not complete all the steps of
            online reporting process including the payment of seat acceptance
            fee.

            instructed by the JOSAA portal to secure your seat and proceed with
            further admission procedures.

          I was allocated and confirmed a seat in a certain round in an
          Institute of NIT+system. I have now been allocated another seat of
          higher preference in my choice list in another Institute of
          NIT+system. Do I need to report again online?
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            No, if you have already completed all the steps of online reporting
            process in a certain round in reporting center of NIT+system and you
            have been allocated another seat of higher preference in your choice

          I was NOT allocated a seat during the first 5 Rounds of JoSAA.

            process of JoSAA or report to the admitting Institute (including
            payment of seat acceptance fee) to confirm your seat. If you do not
            complete the reporting process, you will be eligible for appearing
            in JEE (Advanced) in the subsequent year provided you meet all other
            eligibility requirements.
